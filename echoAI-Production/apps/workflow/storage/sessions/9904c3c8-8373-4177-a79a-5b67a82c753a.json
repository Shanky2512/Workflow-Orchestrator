            "crew_result": "**Risk Level:** High  \n\n**Key Findings**\n- **Data Exposure During Transfer:** 2.3\u202fmillion records containing PII (including SSNs) are moved over the network; unencrypted or poorly secured channels can lead to interception.\n- **Insufficient Encryption at Rest:** If the target RDS PostgreSQL instance is not configured with AWS\u2011managed encryption (KMS) or customer\u2011managed keys, data can be read by unauthorized parties.\n- **Over\u2011privileged IAM Roles:** Migration scripts or applications may use IAM credentials with excessive permissions, increasing insider\u2011threat and accidental data leakage risks.\n- **Misconfigured Security Groups / Network Controls:** Publicly accessible RDS endpoints or overly permissive inbound rules can expose the database to the internet or other VPC resources.\n- **Lack of Network Segmentation:** Absence of VPC isolation or private subnets can allow lateral movement from compromised assets to the database.\n- **Inadequate Auditing & Logging:** Missing or insufficient CloudTrail, RDS audit logs, and database activity monitoring hinder detection of anomalous access.\n- **Compliance Gaps:** Handling of SSNs and other regulated data must meet GDPR, CCPA, or industry\u2011specific standards; migration may introduce gaps in consent, retention, or deletion controls.\n- **Insufficient Testing of Rollback/Recovery:** Without validated backup and restore procedures, data loss or corruption during migration could be unrecoverable.\n- **Third\u2011Party or Custom Code Vulnerabilities:** Migration scripts may introduce SQL injection, improper error handling, or hard\u2011coded credentials.\n\n**Recommended Actions**\n1. **Encrypt Data in Transit** \u2013 Use TLS\u202f1.2+ for all client\u2011to\u2011RDS connections; enforce SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer or application layer.\n2. **Enable Encryption at Rest** \u2013 Activate AWS KMS\u2011managed encryption for the RDS instance; rotate keys regularly and restrict access via key policies.\n3. **Apply Least\u2011Privilege IAM** \u2013 Create dedicated IAM roles for migration with only the required permissions (e.g., `rds:CreateDBInstance`, `s3:GetObject` if using S3 for export). Review and revoke any overly broad policies.\n4. **Network Hardening** \u2013 Deploy the RDS instance in a private subnet, restrict inbound access to known IP ranges or via a bastion host, and use security groups to limit ports to only what is needed (typically 5432 for PostgreSQL).\n5. **Implement Network Segmentation** \u2013 Use VPC endpoints or PrivateLink to access RDS without traversing the public internet; consider AWS Transit Gateway for multi\u2011VPC connectivity.\n6. **Enable Comprehensive Auditing** \u2013 Turn on RDS native audit logs, enable CloudTrail data events for RDS, and forward logs to a centralized SIEM for real\u2011time monitoring.\n7. **Validate Compliance Controls** \u2013 Conduct a gap analysis against relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and apply data\u2011masking or tokenization for SSNs where full exposure is unnecessary.\n8. **Perform Pre\u2011Migration Security Testing** \u2013 Run static code analysis on migration scripts, perform penetration testing of the source and target environments, and verify that no hard\u2011coded secrets are introduced.\n9. **Test Backup & Recovery** \u2013 Take snapshots of the source database, restore them to a test RDS instance, and validate that encryption, IAM, and network settings are correctly applied. Document a rollback plan.\n10. **Post\u2011Migration Monitoring** \u2013 Set up automated alerts for unusual query patterns, privileged account usage, or access from unexpected IP ranges; schedule regular security reviews of IAM policies and security group configurations.",
