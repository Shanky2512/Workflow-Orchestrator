            "crew_result": "**Risk Level:** High  \n\n**Key Findings**\n- **Data Exposure During Transfer:** 2.3\u202fmillion records containing PII (names, emails, SSNs) will traverse the network; unencrypted transfers could lead to interception.\n- **In\u2011Transit Encryption Gaps:** If TLS/SSL is not enforced end\u2011to\u2011end, data can be captured by man\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle attacks.\n- **At\u2011Rest Encryption Risks:** PostgreSQL on RDS must be configured with encryption at rest (AWS KMS\u2011managed keys); misconfiguration could expose data if storage is compromised.\n- **Insufficient IAM Controls:** Over\u2011privileged database and migration roles may grant excessive access to the data, increasing insider\u2011threat exposure.\n- **Network Perimeter Mis\u2011configuration:** Publicly accessible endpoints or open security groups could allow unauthorized access to the source SQL Server or target RDS instance.\n- **Lack of Network Segmentation:** Absence of VPC isolation or private subnets may expose the database to lateral movement from compromised assets.\n- **Inadequate Logging & Monitoring:** Missing audit logs for migration activities, database access, and data changes can hinder detection of breaches.\n- **Compliance Violations:** Handling of SSNs and other regulated PII requires adherence to standards such as GDPR, CCPA, or industry\u2011specific regulations; non\u2011compliance can result in legal penalties.\n- **Backup and Recovery Exposure:** Backups stored without encryption or proper access controls could become a data leakage vector.\n- **Insufficient Penetration Testing:** Skipping security testing of the migration pipeline leaves undiscovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited post\u2011migration.\n\n**Recommended Actions**\n1. **Enforce End\u2011to\u2011End Encryption**  \n   - Use TLS\u202f1.2+ for all data in transit between on\u2011premise SQL Server and AWS RDS.  \n   - Verify certificate validation and disable fallback to unencrypted connections.\n\n2. **Enable At\u2011Rest Encryption**  \n   - Activate Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) or AWS RDS encryption with customer\u2011managed KMS keys.  \n   - Rotate encryption keys periodically.\n\n3. **Apply Least\u2011Privilege IAM**  \n   - Create dedicated IAM roles for migration with scoped permissions (e.g., only `rds:CreateDBInstance`, `rds:ModifyDBInstance`).  \n   - Review and remove any overly permissive policies.\n\n4. **Network Segmentation & Access Controls**  \n   - Deploy the migration within a private VPC; use VPN or AWS Direct Connect for on\u2011premise connectivity.  \n   - Restrict security groups so only required IPs/ports are reachable; block public internet access to both source and target databases.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring**  \n   - Enable AWS CloudTrail, RDS Performance Insights, and database audit logs.  \n   - Forward logs to a SIEM for real\u2011time alerting on anomalous access or data export patterns.\n\n6. **Data Masking / Tokenization (Optional)**  \n   - For SSNs and other highly sensitive fields, consider masking or tokenization before migration to reduce exposure.\n\n7. **Secure Backup Practices**  \n   - Encrypt RDS snapshots and any exported backups; store them in a separate, tightly controlled bucket with MFA\u2011delete enabled.\n\n8. **Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Scanning**  \n   - Conduct pre\u2011migration security assessments of the migration scripts, network paths, and target RDS configuration.  \n   - Remediate findings before production cut\u2011over.\n\n9. **Compliance Review**  \n   - Map the migration workflow to relevant regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR Art.\u202f32, HIPAA, PCI\u2011DSS).  \n   - Document data\u2011handling procedures and obtain necessary approvals.\n\n10. **Post\u2011Migration Validation**  \n    - Perform integrity checks and data\u2011loss testing.  \n    - Conduct a final security review and obtain sign\u2011off from the security governance board before going live.",
