            "crew_result": "**Risk Level:** High  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n- **Data Exposure in Transit:** Moving 2.3\u202fM records over the network increases the attack surface; unencrypted traffic could be intercepted.  \n- **Data at Rest Vulnerabilities:** RDS storage may not be encrypted by default; lack of encryption or weak key management could expose PII if storage is compromised.  \n- **Insufficient Network Segmentation:** Improper VPC, subnet, or security\u2011group configurations could allow lateral movement from compromised resources.  \n- **IAM Misconfigurations:** Over\u2011privileged roles or shared credentials may grant unauthorized access to the database.  \n- **Logging & Monitoring Gaps:** Inadequate audit logging or alerting can delay detection of breaches or anomalous activity.  \n- **Compliance & Regulatory Risks:** Handling SSNs and other PII in the cloud must meet GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, or industry\u2011specific standards; non\u2011compliance can result in fines.  \n- **Backup & Disaster Recovery Weaknesses:** Unencrypted or improperly stored backups could become a data leakage vector.  \n- **Third\u2011Party Integration Risks:** Migration scripts, ETL tools, or external connectors may introduce additional attack vectors if not hardened.  \n- **Insider Threat:** Employees with privileged access to the source or target environment could exfiltrate PII if controls are lax.  \n\n**Recommended Actions:**  \n- **Encrypt Data in Transit:** Use TLS\u202f1.2+ for all database connections; enforce SSL/TLS termination at the application layer.  \n- **Enable Encryption at Rest:** Activate RDS Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) or AWS KMS\u2011managed encryption for the PostgreSQL instance; rotate keys regularly.  \n- **Network Hardening:** Deploy the RDS instance in a private subnet, restrict access via security groups, and use VPC peering or VPN with strict ACLs.  \n- **Apply Least\u2011Privilege IAM:** Create dedicated IAM roles with scoped permissions; enforce MFA for privileged accounts.  \n- **Implement Robust Logging & Monitoring:** Enable CloudTrail, RDS Performance Insights, and enable audit logging; integrate with a SIEM for real\u2011time alerts.  \n- **Secure Backup Strategy:** Encrypt RDS snapshots and store them in a separate, encrypted bucket; apply lifecycle policies and regular restoration tests.  \n- **Data Masking / Tokenization:** Consider masking or tokenizing SSNs before migration to reduce exposure if logs or backups are accessed.  \n- **Conduct Security Assessments:** Perform penetration testing and configuration reviews of both source and target environments pre\u2011 and post\u2011migration.  \n- **Compliance Review:** Map the migration to relevant regulatory requirements; implement data\u2011retention, breach\u2011notification, and access\u2011control policies accordingly.  \n- **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and rehearse a response playbook specific to database compromise scenarios.  \n- **Third\u2011Party Tool Hardening:** Validate and patch any migration utilities; restrict their network access and audit their execution logs.  \n- **Employee Training:** Educate staff on handling PII, phishing, and proper credential management to mitigate insider risk.  \n\nBy addressing these findings with the outlined actions, the organization can significantly reduce the security risk associated with migrating sensitive customer data to AWS RDS PostgreSQL.",
