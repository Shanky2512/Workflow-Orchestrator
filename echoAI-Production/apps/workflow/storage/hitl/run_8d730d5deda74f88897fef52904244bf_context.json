    "crew_result": "**Risk Level:** High  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n- **Data Exposure in Transit:** Transferring 2.3\u202fM records, including SSNs and emails, over the network can be intercepted if not protected with TLS/Direct Connect encryption.  \n- **Data at Rest Vulnerabilities:** Improper encryption or mis\u2011configured storage settings in AWS RDS may expose PII if a breach occurs.  \n- **Insufficient IAM Controls:** Over\u2011privileged database users or application roles can lead to unauthorized access or data exfiltration.  \n- **Network Mis\u2011configuration:** Publicly accessible endpoints or open security groups increase the attack surface.  \n- **Compliance Gaps:** Failure to meet GDPR, CCPA, or industry\u2011specific regulations (e.g., PCI\u2011DSS) when handling PII in the cloud.  \n- **Inadequate Auditing & Monitoring:** Lack of logging, alerting, or anomaly detection on database access can delay detection of breaches.  \n- **Backup & Recovery Risks:** Unencrypted snapshots or improper retention policies may store PII in insecure locations.  \n- **Third\u2011Party Integration Exposure:** APIs or ETL processes that move data may introduce additional attack vectors if not hardened.  \n\n**Recommended Actions:**  \n- **Encrypt Data in Transit:** Use TLS 1.2+ for all migration traffic; consider AWS Direct Connect with IPsec for dedicated, encrypted connectivity.  \n- **Encrypt Data at Rest:** Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) or AWS RDS encryption at rest; enforce customer\u2011managed KMS keys with least\u2011privilege access.  \n- **Implement Strict IAM Policies:** Create dedicated IAM roles with scoped permissions; enforce MFA and use AWS Secrets Manager for credentials.  \n- **Network Segmentation:** Deploy the RDS instance within a private VPC subnet; restrict inbound access to known IP ranges; use security groups and NACLs to limit exposure.  \n- **Enable Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring:** Activate CloudTrail, RDS Performance Insights, and enable audit logs; integrate with Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub for real\u2011time threat detection.  \n- **Apply Data Masking / Tokenization:** Mask or tokenize SSNs and other sensitive fields in non\u2011production environments to reduce exposure.  \n- **Validate Compliance Controls:** Conduct a gap analysis against relevant regulations; implement required controls (e.g., data residency, retention, breach notification).  \n- **Secure Backup & Snapshots:** Ensure automated backups are encrypted; store them in a separate, access\u2011controlled bucket; apply lifecycle policies to limit retention.  \n- **Perform Penetration Testing & Code Review:** Conduct pre\u2011migration security testing of migration scripts, ETL pipelines, and application code; remediate identified vulnerabilities.  \n- **Establish Incident Response Playbook:** Define procedures for data breach containment, notification, and forensic investigation specific to PII incidents.  \n\nThese steps will significantly reduce the security risk associated with migrating sensitive customer data to AWS RDS PostgreSQL.",
