    "crew_result": "**Risk Level:** High  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n- **Data Exposure During Transfer:** Unencrypted or poorly protected data in transit between on\u2011premise SQL Server and AWS RDS can be intercepted.  \n- **Misconfigured AWS Resources:** Improper security\u2011group settings, public\u2011accessible RDS endpoints, or overly permissive IAM roles increase attack surface.  \n- **Insufficient Encryption at Rest:** If PostgreSQL storage encryption (AWS KMS) is not enabled or misconfigured, PII (SSNs, emails) may be exposed.  \n- **Inadequate Access Controls:** Over\u2011privileged database users or lack of role\u2011based access can lead to insider misuse or external compromise.  \n- **Logging & Monitoring Gaps:** Missing audit logs for data access, export, or configuration changes hinder detection of malicious activity.  \n- **Compliance Violations:** Handling of regulated PII (e.g., SSNs) without proper data\u2011masking, tokenization, or retention policies may breach GDPR, CCPA, or industry standards.  \n- **Backup & Recovery Risks:** Unprotected snapshots or backup storage could leak data if not encrypted or access\u2011controlled.  \n- **Network Perimeter Exposure:** Direct exposure of RDS to the internet or insufficient network segmentation raises the likelihood of brute\u2011force or credential\u2011stuffing attacks.  \n\n**Recommended Actions:**  \n- **Encrypt Data in Transit:** Use TLS/SSL for all database connections; enforce mutual authentication.  \n- **Enable Encryption at Rest:** Activate AWS KMS\u2011managed encryption for the RDS instance and ensure snapshots are encrypted.  \n- **Apply Least\u2011Privilege IAM & DB Roles:** Restrict IAM policies and PostgreSQL roles to only required permissions; use role\u2011based access control.  \n- **Restrict Network Access:** Place RDS in a private subnet, use security groups/VPC firewalls to allow only authorized sources, and consider VPC peering or VPN for migration traffic.  \n- **Implement Comprehensive Auditing:** Enable RDS audit logs, CloudTrail, and database activity monitoring; forward logs to a SIEM for real\u2011time alerts.  \n- **Data Masking/Tokenization for PII:** Apply masking or tokenization to SSNs and other sensitive fields before migration and in production.  \n- **Secure Backup Storage:** Encrypt RDS snapshots and backup copies; store them in a separate, access\u2011controlled bucket with lifecycle policies.  \n- **Conduct Security Review & Penetration Testing:** Perform pre\u2011migration configuration reviews and post\u2011migration penetration tests to validate controls.  \n- **Maintain Compliance Documentation:** Document data\u2011handling procedures, retention policies, and ensure alignment with relevant regulatory requirements.  \n- **Train Personnel:** Educate staff on secure migration practices, handling of PII, and incident response procedures.",
