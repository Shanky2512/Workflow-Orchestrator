    "crew_result": "**Risk Level:** High  \n\n**Key Findings**  \n- **Data Exposure During Transfer:** Data in transit between on\u2011premise SQL Server and AWS RDS may be intercepted if not protected with strong TLS encryption.  \n- **Insufficient Encryption at Rest:** If the PostgreSQL instance is not configured with AWS\u2011managed encryption (KMS) or customer\u2011managed keys, PII (SSNs, emails) could be readable to unauthorized parties.  \n- **Over\u2011privileged IAM Roles:** Migration scripts or applications may use IAM credentials with excessive permissions, increasing the attack surface.  \n- **Misconfigured Security Groups / Network Controls:** Publicly accessible RDS endpoints or overly permissive inbound rules can expose the database to the internet.  \n- **Lack of Network Segmentation:** Absence of VPC isolation, private subnets, or VPN/Direct Connect may allow lateral movement from compromised on\u2011premise assets.  \n- **Inadequate Auditing & Monitoring:** Missing database activity logs, CloudTrail alerts, or RDS Performance Insights can delay detection of anomalous access.  \n- **Compliance Gaps:** Handling of personally identifiable information (PII) must meet GDPR, CCPA, or industry\u2011specific regulations; migration may affect data residency and retention policies.  \n- **Backup & Recovery Risks:** Unencrypted snapshots or improper lifecycle policies could lead to data leakage or loss.  \n- **Insufficient Patch Management:** PostgreSQL versions in RDS require regular minor version upgrades; delays can leave known vulnerabilities unaddressed.  \n\n**Recommended Actions**  \n1. **Encrypt Data in Transit** \u2013 Use TLS 1.2+ for all database connections; enforce SSL/TLS certificates on client and server sides.  \n2. **Enable Encryption at Rest** \u2013 Activate AWS KMS\u2011managed encryption for the RDS instance; rotate keys regularly and restrict access via key policies.  \n3. **Apply Least\u2011Privilege IAM** \u2013 Create dedicated IAM roles for migration tools with only the required permissions (e.g., `rds-db:connect`, `s3:GetObject` if using S3 for export).  \n4. **Network Hardening** \u2013 Deploy the RDS instance in a private subnet, use security groups to allow only trusted IP ranges, and consider VPC peering or Direct Connect for secure connectivity.  \n5. **Implement Comprehensive Monitoring** \u2013 Enable CloudTrail, RDS Event Subscriptions, and Amazon GuardDuty; set up alerts for unusual query patterns or failed login attempts.  \n6. **Audit & Compliance Review** \u2013 Conduct a data\u2011classification assessment; ensure encryption, logging, and retention meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR Art. 32, HIPAA).  \n7. **Secure Backup Strategy** \u2013 Encrypt RDS snapshots, store them in a separate, restricted bucket, and apply lifecycle policies to limit exposure.  \n8. **Patch Management & Version Control** \u2013 Subscribe to AWS minor version auto\u2011upgrade or schedule regular patch windows; test upgrades in a staging environment first.  \n9. **Penetration Testing & Red\u2011Team Exercises** \u2013 Perform pre\u2011migration and post\u2011migration security assessments to validate controls.  \n10. **Data Masking / Tokenization (Optional)** \u2013 For non\u2011essential fields (e.g., SSNs), consider tokenization or format\u2011preserving encryption to reduce impact of a breach.  \n\nBy addressing these findings with the outlined actions, the organization can significantly mitigate the security risks associated with migrating 2.3\u202fmillion PII records to AWS RDS PostgreSQL.",
