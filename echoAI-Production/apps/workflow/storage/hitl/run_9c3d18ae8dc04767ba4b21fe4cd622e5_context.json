    "crew_result": "**Risk Level:** Critical  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n- **Large Volume of Sensitive PII:** 2.3\u202fmillion records contain names, emails, and SSNs \u2013 a high\u2011value target for attackers.  \n- **Data in Transit Exposure:** Migration typically uses network channels; if not encrypted end\u2011to\u2011end, data can be intercepted.  \n- **Mis\u2011configured AWS Resources:** Common pitfalls include open security groups, overly permissive IAM roles, and public\u2011accessible RDS endpoints.  \n- **Insufficient Encryption at Rest:** RDS may default to default storage encryption settings; failure to enable KMS\u2011managed encryption leaves data vulnerable.  \n- **Inadequate Backup Protection:** Database snapshots and automated backups could be accessible to unauthorized principals if not properly scoped.  \n- **Lack of Network Segmentation:** Migration may bypass existing segmentation controls, exposing the new RDS instance to broader network traffic.  \n- **Compliance Gaps:** Transferring EU/US citizen data to AWS may trigger GDPR, CCPA, or other regulatory obligations that require specific safeguards.  \n- **Insufficient Auditing & Monitoring:** Absence of detailed logging for migration activities can hinder detection of anomalous behavior.  \n- **Privilege Creep:** Temporary migration accounts often receive elevated privileges that are not revoked after completion.  \n- **Patch & Configuration Drift:** New RDS instance may lag behind latest security patches or best\u2011practice configurations compared to the on\u2011prem environment.  \n\n**Recommended Actions:**  \n1. **Encrypt Data End\u2011to\u2011End:** Use TLS\u202f1.2+ for all migration traffic; enforce SSL/TLS on the target RDS endpoint.  \n2. **Apply Principle of Least Privilege:** Create dedicated IAM roles with scoped permissions for migration tools; delete them post\u2011migration.  \n3. **Enable Server\u2011Side Encryption:** Turn on AWS KMS\u2011managed encryption for RDS storage; verify that snapshots inherit the same encryption.  \n4. **Restrict Network Access:** Place the RDS instance in a private subnet, use security groups to allow only required source IPs, and consider VPC endpoints for S3/other services.  \n5. **Implement Robust Logging & Monitoring:** Enable CloudTrail, RDS audit logs, and configure alerts for unusual access patterns or failed login attempts.  \n6. **Validate Compliance Requirements:** Conduct a data\u2011transfer impact assessment; apply necessary controls (e.g., data\u2011localization, consent documentation).  \n7. **Secure Backups:** Restrict backup access via IAM policies; encrypt backup copies and test restoration under least\u2011privilege conditions.  \n8. **Patch & Harden RDS:** Apply the latest DB engine patches immediately; run AWS RDS security best\u2011practice scans (e.g., CIS Benchmarks).  \n9. **Perform Post\u2011Migration Review:** Conduct a security audit of the migrated database, including penetration testing and configuration validation.  \n10. **Retire Temporary Resources:** Remove any temporary migration servers, IAM roles, and security groups that are no longer needed.  \n\nThese steps will significantly reduce the attack surface and help ensure that the migration of sensitive customer data to AWS RDS is performed securely.",
